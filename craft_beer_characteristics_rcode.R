The goal of the project was to create a tasting profile on beer based on word counts for a classification and recommendation system.  The descriptive words represent the tasting profile features of the beer, and are defined by word counts found in up to 25 reviews of each beer. The assumption is that people writing reviews are more than likely describing what they do experience rather than what they do not.
Note that one or two styles did not have 50 beers to collect information on, and that few beers may have had limited or no reviews available to define features with. Link:https://www.kaggle.com/stephenpolozoff/top-beer-information?select=beer_data_set.csv")
